Obtain user data from an instagram profile by either providing a username or user id.
Take instagram's heavy rate-limits for unofficial endpoints into account when using this script.

User authentication is not required to use this script; in fact, it isnâ€™t even possible unless I explicitly add that functionality.

### Usage: `python main.py <id|username> <value>`
## username value should be the user's handle (in case of instagram.com/therock `therock` would be the handle
## id value can be acquired by first pulling the username through the script


VPNs are wonky BTW



### Working proof of concept at the time of writing
